# Hi, I'm Yuki Kume

## About me

I'm a Computer Science Advanced (Honours)© student at Monash University.

I am a mixed-breed of these things, some of which I've been doing for a decade now:
- Software engineering - specifically in systems and network programming (Lost interest in web development, probably because I mostly did PHP)
- Security engineering - anywhere from tooling, code review to penetration testing 
- Infrastructure and systems engineering - automate boring things to focus on the fun and important things; immutable infrastructure all the way
- Security research - anyting !windows. Yet to obtain a CVE, but I'm working on it
- Academic research - in security in privacy, designing and implementing secure network protocols using cryptographic primitives

I used to homelab with Dell Poweredge R730 and R620, but ended up donating them to my university's cybersecurity club [MonSec](https://monsec.io).

My toolchain is mostly C++, which I've been using for a decade now, but slowly transitioning Rust in the last 2 years. Python is my go-to for scripting and automation, and I've been using it for quite a while now as well, but also slowly replacing with Golang, [Mojo also looks interesting but never had time to explore](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

I daily-drive Fedora with [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) as my window manager, I'm one of those people who has their own customised Neovim setup like a nerd, but use IntelliJ when I have to use Java. I have over a dozen virtual machines on my poor ThinkPad P1 laptop, where I'm currently (Oct. 2024) trying out NixOS since it seems to be the new "I use NixOS btw"©.

## Epilogue

Thought my website is a bit too simple?

Well, you were able to read this far into the website, what the hell else do you want? It probably loaded quite fast as well.

Taking the approach of [the best website in the world](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com) and not writing an over-engineered-framework-heavy-react-redux-webpack-tailwind-css-infinite-npm-dependencies-vue-angular-nextjs-50mb-parallax-ative homepage.
